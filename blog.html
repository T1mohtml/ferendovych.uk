<h3>Hi, my name is Timo. I started coding around 2022-ish, and the story is fascinating:</h3>
<h4>I started with Python Turtle - it went very, very well. I LOVED it! I also started trying HTML, and then, a few years later, I began learning C#. I was using C# for Unity games; it went really well, and I started getting into it. Then I got PyCharm, and after that, I was literally unstoppable - I was coding left and right. And now: THIS!</h4>
